- **Check console:** Look for error messages in Chrome's developer console

### No Icons Showing
- **Missing icon files:** Make sure icon16.png, icon48.png, and icon128.png are in your extension folder
- **Wrong file names:** Icon files must be named exactly as specified

### API Key Issues
- **Invalid key:** Double-check you copied the API key correctly
- **No quota:** Ensure your Google AI Studio account has API quota available
- **Network issues:** Check your internet connection

### No Notifications on LinkedIn
- **Wrong page:** Make sure you're on LinkedIn.com (not LinkedIn Learning, etc.)
- **Extension disabled:** Check that the extension is enabled in chrome://extensions/
- **Refresh page:** Try refreshing the LinkedIn page
- **Check console:** Open browser developer tools (F12) and look for error messages

### Performance Issues
- **Too many posts:** The extension processes posts with delays to avoid rate limiting
- **Close other tabs:** Free up browser resources
- **Check API quota:** Ensure you haven't exceeded your Gemini API limits
